/** @file
*
*  Implement EFI RealTimeClock runtime services based on ARM Performance Counter.
*
*  Currently this driver does not support time setting, alarms, or runtime calls.
*  This special library is NOT meant to replace a HW RTC implementation to
*  measure date/time. Use this library ONLY to measure relative time between
*  two EFI_GET_TIME readings.
*  The performance counter will wrap-around eventually after a long time, make
*  sure to consider this limitation if you are depending on this library for
*  relative time measurement. e.g. For the ARM 64-bit counter with 19.2MHz
*  frequency, the counter will wrap-around after approximately 30465 year.

/**
  Returns the current time and date information, and the time-keeping capabilities
  of the virtual RTC.

  For simplicity, this LibGetTime does not report Years/Months, instead it will
  only report current Day, Hours, Minutes and Seconds starting from the beginning
  of CPU up-time. Otherwise, a more complex logic will be required to account
  for leap years and days/month differences.

  @param  Time                  A pointer to storage to receive a snapshot of
                                the current time.
  @param  Capabilities          An optional pointer to a buffer to receive the
                                real time clock device's capabilities.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The operation completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Time is NULL.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The time could not be retrieved due to hardware error.
